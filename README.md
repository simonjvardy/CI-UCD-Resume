## Design Choices ##

### Fonts ###

We have chosen [Exo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo?category=Sans+Serif) for all of the headers and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?category=Sans+Serif) the rest of the text.

### Colours ###

We have chosen the colour that say ... appealing to the eye and also compliments the design of the project.
![Colour palette](assets/images/resume-palette.png)

- *Davys Grey* (525252) - Dark Grey
- *Dim Grey* (676767) - Mid Grey
- *Cultured* (F4F4F4) - Off white
- *Carolina Blue* (3498D8) - Light Blue
- *Purple Plum* (9B59B6) - Purple
- *Cadmium Orange* (E67E22) - Orange
- *Flame* (E84610) - Dark Orange

These colours will compliment each other well when used across the site creating a contrasting and dynamic ambience.

### Wireframes ###

We designed our site mock-ups using [balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). We were focusing on defining basic layout structure of the site and identifying how displays would change on different screen sizes such as [mobile](/wireframes/mobile.jpg), [tablet](/wireframes/tablet.jpg) and [desktop](/wireframes/desktop.jpg).
